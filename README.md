# Movie_comment_classification
The code uses TF-IDF vectorization of initial data, and then applies 4 methods (k nearest neighbours, logistic regression, Bernoullii naive Bayes, multinomial naive Bayes)
Each method has been used with different values of the hyperparameters (number of neghbours, regularization parameter, and smoothing parameter respectively)
Also values of ngram = (1,1) , (1,2) , (2,2) have been used in tfidf vectorizer
HashingVectorizer was used to compare its results to tfidf vectorizer
